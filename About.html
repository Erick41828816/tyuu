        <h1>BRIEF BACKGROUND <br> OF MAKUTI</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">One of the interesting things about design is the combination of traditional and contemporary aspects.
            I am sure you have come across hotels, restaurants and serviced apartments, like the Kings Post, with
            a makuti fling to add in a mix of nature and luxury. Martin shares with you the Makuti story, a
            popular coastal element.</p>
            <img src="cone.jpg" alt="con" width="500px" height="500px">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Makuti is thatch material made from dried coconut palm leaves. Thatching is a technique where layers of
             dried vegetation are lined up in such a way, so as to shelter an interior from being soaked in 
             rainfall. Implication here is that, several layers of dried makuti have to be stacked one over 
             another, until a sufficient thickness is attained, about 1 foot is suitable to make the roof 
             impervious to water, and also provide insulation from the elements of weather.<br>

Thatched roofing is not exclusive to our tropical climate, but has also been used in temperate regions for
 millenia. Only difference is that, in temperate Countries, Houses with thatched roofing are an exclusive feature
  for wealthy individuals, who find it ecologically friendly. In Countries in the tropical Regions, thatched
   roofing is used in numerous ethnic groups’ housing style. Even so, Hotel owners use thatched makuti roofing 
   as a signature look for their unique structures, especially in the East African Coast. <br>

Makuti roofing is made from individual weaved palm fronds. Women in local villages at the Coastal area usually 
do the weaving by hand. The palm fronds are harvested from Coconut trees, without any interference to the growth 
of the tree. The dried up fronds, are the ones that are specifically targeted during harvesting.</p>
